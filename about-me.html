            <p>I was born on March 15th, 1986 in Aga&ntilde;a, Guam. I moved around alot as a child and finally settled in Spring Valley, CA in 1997<br>
            I got my first ob at Jack in the Box in 9th grade in 2000 and have over 40 jobs since then.<br>
            I am currently a city bus operator for TransDev(MTS) and I truly enjoy being able to help the public get to their destinations.<br>
            My dad was a computer analyst for the military for 20 years and instilled in my my interest in computers and how they work.<br>
            I have been studying coding now since July of 2024 and I'm excited to learn the ins and outs of this industry.</p>
